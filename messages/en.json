      "q1": "What does it cost to request a quote?",
      "a1": "At Bouwmatcher, requesting quotes is completely free. Specialists only pay us when their quote is accepted by you. This keeps it transparent and cost-free for you as a customer.",
      "q2": "Why do I sometimes receive fewer than 5 quotes?",
      "a2": "We only select specialists who truly match your project based on location, specialization and availability. Quality comes first – sometimes that's 3, sometimes 5. We prefer few good matches over many bad ones.",
      "q3": "How quickly does a specialist respond?",
      "a3": "On average, you'll receive responses from interested specialists within 24-48 hours. The specialist will contact you directly to schedule an appointment.",
      "q4": "Can I modify my request after submission?",

      "q5": "Do I get a warranty on the work?",
      "a5": "Warranty is agreed directly with the specialist. All professionals on our platform are registered with the Chamber of Commerce and often affiliated with trade organizations that offer warranty schemes.",
      "q6": "How do I compare quotes?",
      "a6": "Don't just look at price, but also at experience, portfolio, reviews and communication. A good match is more important than the lowest price.",
      "q7": "What if I'm not satisfied with the specialist?",
      "a7": "Discuss this directly with the specialist first. If this doesn't lead to a solution, contact our team. We'll work together to find an appropriate solution.",
      "q8": "What if someone doesn't show up or communicates poorly?",
      "a8": "Report this directly to us via info@bouwmatcher.com. We'll contact the specialist and look for an alternative if necessary. Professionals who repeatedly receive complaints are removed from our platform.",
      "q9": "Is my data safe?",
      "a9": "Yes, your data is only shared with the specialists who respond to your request. We comply with GDPR and never share your data with third parties without your permission."

      "a4": "You see all project details: location, desired execution date, description, any photos and customer contact information.",
